<b>I'm Ayana</b>, a CS student in the Bay Area. I have a passion for using coding skills for social causes and supporting under-represented groups in STEM.

<b>Currently</b>, I'm developing applications with [Trill Project](https://trillproject.com) and [Develop for Good](https://developforgood.org) to de-stigmatize mental health and give students access to tech.

<b>In the past</b>, I've attended CS programs at [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/) and [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/pre-college/academic-programs/sams.html), and studied abroad in Ghana!

<b>Outside of coding</b>, I love playing my kalimba, crocheting, and learning about other cultures. I love to chat with new people, so feel free to [say hi!](#contact)
